\section{R implementation comparison}

We compare our implementation using {\sc read.table} to one using the `VariantAnnotation' package. Reading the VCF file to a matrix with `readGT' is faster than reading a VCF file to a
table using R's `read.table', at 138 seconds compared to 208 seconds. However, the entire process takes around 30 minutes, so the relative savings in time are minimal.
One other difference is that `readGT' produces a matrix of variants, so we don't need to remove the first nine columns. However, this step takes less than one second.
The function to convert the variant strings to the Hamming distance consumes the majority of the time required for preprocessing. However, we created this as a vectorized function to
improve performance.
