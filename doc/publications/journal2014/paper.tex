\begin{abstract} % abstract
\parttitle{Motivation}: Genomic information is increasingly used in medical research, giving rise to the need for efficient analysis methodology able to cope with thousands of individuals and millions of variants. The widely used Hadoop MapReduce architecture and associated machine-learning library, Mahout, provide the means for tackling computationally challenging tasks. However, many genomic analyses do not fit the Map-Reduce paradigm. We therefore survey the recently developed Spark engine, along with its associated machine learning library, MLlib, which are more flexible in the parallelisation architecture and hence more suitable for population-scale bioinformatics tasks. To do this, we developed an interface from Mahout and MLlib to the standard variant format (VCF), which opens up the usage of advanced, efficient machine learning algorithms to genomic data. 

\parttitle{Results}: We successfully clustered more than 2,500 individuals each having more than 81 Million variants. Both Hadoop and Spark have superior performance over traditional approaches. We observe a 50 fold speedup when using the efficient in-memory Spark compute engine compared to Hadoop. Furthermore, our implementation achieves a better performance compared to a previously published Spark-based genome clustering approach, ADAM.

\parttitle{Availability}: The package is written in Java and available at https: //github.com/BauerLab/GeMaIn.
