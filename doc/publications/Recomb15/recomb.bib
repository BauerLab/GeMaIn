	Abstract = {Current genomics data formats and processing pipelines are not designed to scale well to large datasets. The current Sequence/Binary Alignment/Map (SAM/BAM) formats were intended for single node processing. There have been attempts to adapt BAM to distributed computing environments, but they see limited scalability past eight nodes. Additionally, due to the lack of an explicit data schema, there are well known incompatibilities between libraries that implement SAM/BAM/Variant Call Format (VCF) data access.

To address these problems, we introduce ADAM, a set of formats, APIs, and processing stage implementations for genomic data. ADAM is fully open source under the Apache 2 license, and is implemented on top of Avro and Parquet for data storage. Our reference pipeline is implemented on top of Spark, a high performance in-memory map-reduce system. This combination provides the following advantages:

1) Avro provides explicit data schema access in C/C++/C#, Java/Scala, Python, php, and Ruby;
2) Parquet allows access by database systems like Impala and Shark; and
3) Spark improves performance through in-memory caching and reducing disk I/O.

In addition to improving the format's cross-platform portability, these changes lead to significant performance improvements. On a single node, we are able to speedup sort and duplicate marking by 2×. More importantly, on a 250 Gigabyte (GB) high (60×) coverage human genome, this system achieves a 50× speedup on a 100 node computing cluster (see Table 1), fulfilling the promise of scalability of ADAM.

The ADAM format provides explicit schemas for read and reference oriented (pileup) sequence data, variants, and genotypes. As the schemas are implemented in Apache Avro---a cross-platform/language serialization format---they eliminate the need for the development of language-specific libraries for format decoding/encoding, which eliminates the possibility of library incompatibilities.

A key feature of ADAM is that any application that implements the ADAM schema is compatible with ADAM. This is important, as it prevents applications from being locked into a specific tool or pattern. The ADAM stack is inspired by the ``narrow waist'' of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite (see Figure 2). We consider the explicit use of a schema in this format to be the greatest contribution of the ADAM stack.

In addition to the advantages outlined above, ADAM eliminates the file headers in modern genomics formats. All header information is available inside of each individual record. The variant and genotype formats also demonstrate two significant improvements. First, these formats are co-designed so that variant data can be seamlessly calculated from a given collection of sample genotypes. Secondly, these formats are designed to flexibly accommodate annotations without cluttering the core variant/genotype schema. In addition to the benefits described above, ADAM files are up to 25% smaller on disk than compressed BAM files without losing any information.

The ADAM processing pipeline uses Spark as a compute engine and Parquet for data access. Spark is an in-memory MapReduce framework which minimizes I/O accesses. We chose Parquet for data storage as it is an open-source columnar store that is designed for distribution across multiple computers with high compression. Additionally, Parquet sup- ports efficient methods (predicates and projections) for accessing only a specific segment or fields of a file, which can provide significant (2-10×) additional speedup for genomics data access patterns.},

	Abstract = {Current methods for inferring population structure from genetic data do not provide formal significance tests for population differentiation. We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

@article{Zheng2014,
	Abstract = {Genotyping of classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles is an essential tool in the analysis of diseases and adverse drug reactions with associations mapping to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, deriving high-resolution HLA types subsequent to whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing or sequencing is often cost prohibitive for large samples. An alternative approach takes advantage of the extended haplotype structure within the MHC to predict HLA alleles using dense SNP genotypes, such as those available from genome-wide SNP panels. Current methods for HLA imputation are difficult to apply or may require the user to have access to large training data sets with SNP and HLA types. We propose HIBAG, HLA Imputation using attribute BAGging, that makes predictions by averaging HLA-type posterior probabilities over an ensemble of classifiers built on bootstrap samples. We assess the performance of HIBAG using our study data (n=2668 subjects of European ancestry) as a training set and HLA data from the British 1958 birth cohort study (n approximately 1000 subjects) as independent validation samples. Prediction accuracies for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 range from 92.2% to 98.1% using a set of SNP markers common to the Illumina 1M Duo, OmniQuad, OmniExpress, 660K and 550K platforms. HIBAG performed well compared with the other two leading methods, HLA*IMP and BEAGLE. This method is implemented in a freely available HIBAG R package that includes pre-fit classifiers for European, Asian, Hispanic and African ancestries, providing a readily available imputation approach without the need to have access to large training data sets.},

@article{Bureau2005,
	Abstract = {There has been a great interest and a few successes in the identification of complex disease susceptibility genes in recent years. Association studies, where a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are typed in a sample of cases and controls to determine which genes are associated with a specific disease, provide a powerful approach for complex disease gene mapping. Genes of interest in those studies may contain large numbers of SNPs that classical statistical methods cannot handle simultaneously without requiring prohibitively large sample sizes. By contrast, high-dimensional nonparametric methods thrive on large numbers of predictors. This work explores the application of one such method, random forests, to the problem of identifying SNPs predictive of the phenotype in the case-control study design. A random forest is a collection of classification trees grown on bootstrap samples of observations, using a random subset of predictors to define the best split at each node. The observations left out of the bootstrap samples are used to estimate prediction error. The importance of a predictor is quantified by the increase in misclassification occurring when the values of the predictor are randomly permuted. We extend the concept of importance to pairs of predictors, to capture joint effects, and we explore the behavior of importance measures over a range of two-locus disease models in the presence of a varying number of SNPs unassociated with the phenotype. We illustrate the application of random forests with a data set of asthma cases and unaffected controls genotyped at 42 SNPs in ADAM33, a previously identified asthma susceptibility gene. SNPs and SNP pairs highly associated with asthma tend to have the highest importance index value, but predictive importance and association do not always coincide.},

	Abstract = {The number of cancer cases caused by being obese is estimated to be 20\% with the increased risk of malignancies being influenced by diet, weight change, and body fat distribution together with physical activity. Reports from the International Agency for Research into Cancer and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) have shown that the strongest evidence exists for an association of obesity with the following cancer types: endometrial, esophageal adenocarcinoma, colorectal, postmenopausal breast, prostate, and renal, whereas the less common malignancies are leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, and thyroid tumours. To be able to develop novel methods in prevention and treatment, we first must understand the underlying processes which link cancer to obesity. Four main systems have been identified as potential producers of cancer in obesity: insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, sex steroids, and adipokines. Various novel candidate mechanisms have been proposed: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, crosstalk between tumour cells and surrounding adipocytes, migrating adipose stromal cells, obesity-induced hypoxia, shared genetic susceptibility, and the functional defeat of immune function. Herein, we review the major pathogenic links between obesity and susceptibility to cancer.},

	Abstract = {Obesity increases risk for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), yet obese patients appear to experience longer survival than nonobese patients. We examined body mass index (BMI) in relation to stage, grade, and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) while considering detection bias, nutritional status, and molecular tumor features.Data were available from 2119 ccRCC patients who underwent renal mass surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1995 and 2012. Logistic regression models produced associations between BMI and advanced disease. Multivariable competing risks regression models estimated associations between BMI and CSM. Somatic mutation, copy number, methylation, and expression data were examined by BMI among a subset of 126 patients who participated in the Cancer Genome Atlas Project for ccRCC using the Kruskal-Wallis or Fisher exact tests. All statistical tests were two-sided.Obese and overweight patients were less likely to present with advanced-stage disease compared with normal-weight patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.48 to 0.79 vs OR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.51 to 0.83, respectively). Higher BMI was associated with reduced CSM in univariable analyses (P < .005). It remained statistically significant after adjustment for comorbidities and albumin level, but it became non-statistically significant after adjusting for stage and grade (P > .10). Genome-wide interrogation by BMI suggested differences in gene expression of metabolic and fatty acid genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), consistent with the obesity paradox.Our findings suggest that although BMI is not an independent prognostic factor for CSM after controlling for stage and grade, tumors developing in an obesogenic environment may be more indolent.},

	Abstract = {The role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial, despite the biological plausibility that nonlinear molecular interactions underpin the genotype-phenotype map. This controversy arises because most genetic variation for quantitative traits is additive. However, additive variance is consistent with pervasive epistasis. In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks. Epistasis causes hidden quantitative genetic variation in natural populations and could be responsible for the small additive effects, missing heritability and the lack of replication that are typically observed for human complex traits.},

@article{Yoo2012,
	Abstract = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with a variety of common human diseases. Due to the weak marginal effect of most disease-associated SNPs, attention has recently turned to evaluating the combined effect of multiple disease-associated SNPs on the risk of disease. Several recent multigenic studies show potential evidence of applying multigenic approaches in association studies of various diseases including lung cancer. But the question remains as to the best methodology to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms in multiple genes. In this work, we consider four methods-logistic regression, logic regression, classification tree, and random forests-to compare results for identifying important genes or gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions. To evaluate the performance of four methods, the cross-validation misclassification error and areas under the curves are provided. We performed a simulation study and applied them to the data from a large-scale, population-based, case-control study.},
