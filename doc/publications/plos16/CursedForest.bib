 is bounded by heritability, environmental factors

 considered. Large-scale, longitudinal research
 programmes need to study the intrinsic properties

  Abstract                 = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.}

  Abstract                 = {Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is
 a common task in most gene expression studies, where
 researchers try to identify the smallest possible
 set of genes that can still achieve good predictive
 performance (for instance, for future use with
 diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene
 selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene)
 rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds
 to select the number of genes, can only be applied
 to two-class problems, and use gene selection
 ranking criteria unrelated to the classification
 algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a
 classification algorithm well suited for microarray
 data: it shows excellent performance even when most
 predictive variables are noise, can be used when the
 number of variables is much larger than the number
 of observations and in problems involving more than
 two classes, and returns measures of variable
 importance. Thus, it is important to understand the
 performance of random forest with microarray data
 and its possible use for gene selection.\\ We
 investigate the use of random forest for
 classification of microarray data (including
 multi-class problems) and propose a new method of
 gene selection in classification problems based on
 random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray
 data sets we show that random forest has comparable
 performance to other classification methods,
 including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene
 selection procedure yields very small sets of genes
 (often smaller than alternative methods) while
 preserving predictive accuracy.\\ Because of its
 performance and features, random forest and gene
 selection using random forest should probably become
 part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class
 prediction and gene selection with microarray data.}

  Abstract                 = {We review connections between phase transitions in
 high-dimensional combinatorial geometry and phase
 transitions occurring in modern high-dimensional
 data analysis and signal processing. In data
 analysis, such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown
 of linear model selection, robust data fitting or
 compressed sensing reconstructions, when the
 complexity of the model or the number of outliers
 increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial
 geometry, these transitions appear as abrupt changes
 in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes
 when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in
 these very different problems appear in the same
 critical locations after appropriate calibration of
 variables. These thresholds are important in each
 subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard
 limits on the degree to which the now ubiquitous
 high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for
 robustness, they place hard limits on the degree to
 which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate
 outliers before breaking down; for compressed
 sensing, they define the sharp boundary of the
 undersampling/sparsity trade-off curve in
 undersampling theorems. Existing derivations of
 phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume
 that the underlying matrices have independent and
 identically distributed Gaussian elements. In
 applications, however, it often seems that
 Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an
 extensive computational experiment and formal
 inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that
 these phase transitions are universal across a range
 of underlying matrix ensembles. We ran millions of
 linear programs using random matrices spanning
 several matrix ensembles and problem sizes;
 visually, the empirical phase transitions do not
 depend on the ensemble, and they agree extremely
 well with the asymptotic theory assuming
 Gaussianity. Careful statistical analysis reveals
 discrepancies that can be explained as transient
 terms, decaying with problem size. The experimental
 results are thus consistent with an asymptotic
 large-n universality across matrix ensembles;
 finite-sample universality can be
 rejected. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary Osteoporotic fracture is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity in the community. To identify genes associated with osteoporosis, we have performed a genome-wide association study. In order to improve study power and to address the demographic group of highest risk from osteoporotic fracture, we have used a unique study design, studying 1,955 postmenopausal women with either extreme high or low hip bone mineral density. We then confirmed our findings in 20,898 women from the general population. Our study replicated 21 of 26 known osteoporosis genes, and it identified a further six novel loci (in or nearby CLCN7, GALNT3, IBSP, LTBP3, RSPO3, and SOX4). For one of these loci, GALTN3, we demonstrate in a mouse model that a loss-of-function genetic mutation in GALNT3 causes high bone mass. These findings report novel mechanisms by which osteoporosis can arise, and they significantly add to our understanding of the aetiology of the disease.},

 outputvariable y assumes discrete values with
 respectiveprobabilities that depend upon the
 simultaneous values of a set of input variables
 x = {\{}x{\_}1,....,x{\_}n{\}}. At issue is how error in
 the estimates of theseprobabilities affects
 classification error when the estimates are used ina
 classification rule. These effects are seen to be
 somewhat counterintuitive in both their strength and
 nature. In particular the bias andvariance
 components of the estimation error combine to
 influenceclassification in a very different way than
 with squared error on theprobabilities
 themselves. Certain types of (very high) bias can
 becanceled by low variance to produce accurate
 classification. This candramatically mitigate the
 effect of the bias associated with some
 simpleestimators like ``naive'' Bayes, and the bias
 induced by thecurse-of-dimensionality on
 nearest-neighbor procedures. This helps explainwhy
 such simple methods are often competitive with and
 sometimes superiorto more sophisticated ones for
 classification, and why``bagging/aggregating''
 classifiers can often improveaccuracy. These results
 also suggest simple modifications to theseprocedures
 that can (sometimes dramatically) further improve
 theirclassification performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The Random Forests (RF) algorithm has become a commonly
 used machine learning algorithm for genetic
 association studies. It is well suited for genetic
 applications since it is both computationally
 efficient and models genetic causal mechanisms
 well. With its growing ubiquity, there has been
 inconsistent and less than optimal use of RF in the
 literature. The purpose of this review is to
 breakdown the theoretical and statistical basis of
 RF so that practitioners are able to apply it in
 their work. An emphasis is placed on showing how the
 various components contribute to bias and variance,
 as well as discussing variable importance
 measures. Applications specific to genetic studies
 are highlighted. To provide context, RF is compared
 to other commonly used machine learning algorithms.}

  Abstract                 = {The 1000 Genomes Project and
 disease-specific sequencing efforts are producing
 large collections of haplotypes that can be used as
 reference panels for genotype imputation in
 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However,
 imputing from large reference panels with existing
 methods imposes a high computational burden. We
 introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that
 maintains the accuracy of leading methods while
 reducing computational costs. We first statistically
 estimate the haplotypes for each individual within
 the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute
 missing genotypes into these estimated
 haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost
 because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only
 once, whereas standard methods would implicitly
 repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and
 (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS
 haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match
 two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference
 haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH
 and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data
 sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information
 Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
 and the 1000 Genomes Project. This strategy will be
 particularly valuable for repeated imputation as
 reference panels evolve.},

  Abstract                 = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous
 complex disease affecting more than 29 million
 Americans alone with a rising prevalence trending
 toward steady increases in the coming decades. Thus,
 there is a pressing clinical need to improve early
 prevention and clinical management of T2D and its
 complications. Clinicians have understood that
 patients who carry the T2D diagnosis have a variety
 of phenotypes and susceptibilities to
 diabetes-related complications. We used a precision
 medicine approach to characterize the complexity of
 T2D patient populations based on high-dimensional
 electronic medical records (EMRs) and genotype data
 from 11,210 individuals. We successfully identified
 three distinct subgroups of T2D from topology-based
 patient-patient networks. Subtype 1 was
 characterized by T2D complications diabetic
 nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; subtype 2 was
 enriched for cancer malignancy and cardiovascular
 diseases; and subtype 3 was associated most strongly
 with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases,
 allergies, and HIV infections. We performed a
 genetic association analysis of the emergent T2D
 subtypes to identify subtype-specific genetic
 markers and identified 1279, 1227, and 1338
 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped
 to 425, 322, and 437 unique genes specific to
 subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By assessing the
 human disease-SNP association for each subtype, the
 enriched phenotypes and biological functions at the
 gene level for each subtype matched with the disease
 comorbidities and clinical differences that we
 identified through EMRs. Our approach demonstrates
 the utility of applying the precision medicine
 paradigm in T2D and the promise of extending the
 approach to the study of other complex,
 multifactorial diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Osteoporosis, the most prevalent metabolic bone disease among older people, increases risk for low trauma hip fractures (HF) that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hip bone size (BS) has been identified as one of the key measurable risk factors for HF. Although hip BS is highly genetically determined, genetic factors underlying the trait are still poorly defined. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hip BS interrogating ‚àº380,000 SNPs on the Affymetrix platform in 1,000 homogeneous unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 501 females and 499 males. We identified a gene, PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1), that had four SNPs associated with hip BS at, or approaching, a genome-wide significance level in our female subjects; the most significant SNP, rs7595412, achieved a p value of 3.72√ó10‚àí7. The gene's importance to hip BS was replicated using the Illumina genotyping platform in an independent UK cohort containing 1,216 Caucasian females. Two SNPs of the PLCL1 gene, rs892515 and rs9789480, surrounded by the four SNPs identified in our GWAS, achieved p values of 8.62√ó10‚àí3 and 2.44√ó10‚àí3, respectively, for association with hip BS. Imputation analyses on our GWAS and the UK samples further confirmed the replication signals; eight SNPs of the gene achieved combined imputed p values<10‚àí5 in the two samples. The PLCL1 gene's relevance to HF was also observed in a Chinese sample containing 403 females, including 266 with HF and 177 control subjects. A SNP of the PLCL1 gene, rs3771362 that is only ‚àº0.6 kb apart from the most significant SNP detected in our GWAS (rs7595412), achieved a p value of 7.66√ó10‚àí3 (odds ratio = 0.26) for association with HF. Additional biological support for the role of PLCL1 in BS comes from previous demonstrations that the PLCL1 protein inhibits IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-mediated calcium signaling, an important pathway regulating mechanical sensing of bone cells. Our findings suggest that PLCL1 is a novel gene associated with variation in hip BS, and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HF.},

  Abstract                 = {The resurgence of interest in tumor metabolism has led investigators to emphasize the metabolism of proline as a ``stress substrate'' and to suggest this pathway as a potential anti-tumor target. Proline oxidase, a.k.a. proline dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH), catalyzes the first step in proline degradation and uses proline to generate ATP for survival or reactive oxygen species for programmed cell death. POX/PRODH is induced by p53 under genotoxic stress and initiates apoptosis by both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Furthermore, POX/PRODH is induced by PPAR$\gamma$ and its pharmacologic ligands, the thiazolidinediones. The anti-tumor effects of PPAR$\gamma$ may be critically dependent on POX/PRODH. In addition, it is upregulated by nutrient stress through the mTOR pathway to maintain ATP levels. We propose that proline is made available as a stress substrate by the degradation of collagen in the microenvironmental extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases. In a manner analogous to autophagy, this proline-dependent process for bioenergetics from collagen in extracellular matrix can be designated ``ecophagy''.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Although hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcaemia is one of the most frequent clinical features of monoallelic microdeletion of chromosome 22q11 (22q11DS), bone mass and metabolism have not yet been assessed in these patients. DESIGN: This study aimed to evaluate bone mass and metabolism in a cohort of patients, both children and adults, with 22q11DS. METHODS: In twenty-eight patients with 22q11DS (median age 12.5, range 6.1-42.8 years), serum levels of ionised and total calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations were evaluated. In these patients, bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examination, and volumetric BMD (bone mineral apparent density (BMAD)) was calculated. The data obtained from paediatric and adult patients were compared with two age-, sex- and body size-matched healthy subject control groups. RESULTS: Patients with 22q11DS showed a reduced BMAD Z-score compared with controls (P<0.001). These patients also had significantly lower ionised (P<0.001) and total calcium (P<0.05) levels as well as lower PTH levels (P<0.05), compared with the controls. In particular, children and young patients with 22q11DS had significantly lower serum osteocalcin levels (P<0.001), BSAP levels (P<0.001) and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations (P<0.001) than controls. These results were not confirmed in adults. Finally, patients with hypoparathyroidism and/or hypocalcaemia at the time of the study showed significantly lower ionised (P<0.001) and total calcium levels (P<0.001), PTH levels (P<0.05), BSAP levels (P<0.001), osteocalcin levels (P<0.001) and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations (P<0.001), compared with patients without hypoparathyroidism and/or hypocalcaemia. Nonetheless, the BMAD Z-score did not show substantial differences between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with 22q11DS have a significant reduction in bone mass that appears to be more severe in adults who have already attained peak bone mass than in children who are still growing. Therefore, we suggest a close monitoring of bone mass and metabolism in 22q11DS patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Machine learning methods and in particular
 random forests (RFs) are a promising alternative to
 standard single SNP analyses in genome-wide
 association studies (GWAS). RFs provide variable
 importance measures (VIMs) to rank SNPs according to
 their predictive power. However, in contrast to the
 established genome-wide significance threshold, no
 clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs
 should be selected for downstream analyses.We
 propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent
 relative variable importance measure
 (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative
 to an observed minimal importance score for several
 runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in
 all of the runs are selected as
 important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show
 that the new method controls the number of
 false-positives under the null hypothesis. Under a
 simple alternative hypothesis with several
 independent main effects it is only slightly less
 powerful than logistic regression. In an
 experimental GWAS data set, the same strong signal
 is identified while the approach selects none of the
 SNPs in an underpowered GWAS.The novel variable
 selection method r2VIM is a promising extension to
 standard RF for objectively selecting relevant SNPs
 in GWAS while controlling the number of

 structure and the large extent of linkage
 disequilibrium. In this study, we identified
 agronomically important genes in rice using GWAS
 based on whole-genome sequencing, followed by the
 screening of candidate genes based on the estimated
 effect of nucleotide polymorphisms. Using this
 approach, we identified four new genes associated
 with agronomic traits. Some genes were undetectable
 by standard SNP analysis, but we detected them using
 gene-based association analysis. This study provides
 fundamental insights relevant to the rapid
 identification of genes associated with agronomic
 traits using GWAS and will accelerate future efforts
 aimed at crop improvement.},

  abstract      = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed numerous loci for areal bone mineral density (aBMD). We completed the first GWAS meta-analysis (n = 15,275) of lumbar spine volumetric BMD (vBMD) measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT), allowing for examination of the trabecular bone compartment. SNPs that were significantly associated with vBMD were also examined in two GWAS meta-analyses to determine associations with morphometric vertebral fracture (n = 21,701) and clinical vertebral fracture (n = 5893). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of iliac crest biopsies were performed in 84 postmenopausal women, and murine osteoblast expression of genes implicated by eQTL or by proximity to vBMD-associated SNPs was examined. We identified significant vBMD associations with five loci, including: 1p36.12, containing WNT4 and ZBTB40; 8q24, containing TNFRSF11B; and 13q14, containing AKAP11 and TNFSF11. Two loci (5p13 and 1p36.12) also contained associations with radiographic and clinical vertebral fracture, respectively. In 5p13, rs2468531 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 3%) was associated with higher vBMD (β = 0.22, p = 1.9 × 10(-8) ) and decreased risk of radiographic vertebral fracture (odds ratio [OR] = 0.75; false discovery rate [FDR] p = 0.01). In 1p36.12, rs12742784 (MAF = 21%) was associated with higher vBMD (β = 0.09, p = 1.2 × 10(-10) ) and decreased risk of clinical vertebral fracture (OR = 0.82; FDR p = 7.4 × 10(-4) ). Both SNPs are noncoding and were associated with increased mRNA expression levels in human bone biopsies: rs2468531 with SLC1A3 (β = 0.28, FDR p = 0.01, involved in glutamate signaling and osteogenic response to mechanical loading) and rs12742784 with EPHB2 (β = 0.12, FDR p = 1.7 × 10(-3) , functions in bone-related ephrin signaling). Both genes are expressed in murine osteoblasts. This is the first study to link SLC1A3 and EPHB2 to clinically relevant vertebral osteoporosis phenotypes. These results may help elucidate vertebral bone biology and novel approaches to reducing vertebral fracture incidence. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

  abstract        = {Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most widely used predictor of fracture risk. We performed the largest meta-analysis to date on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, including 17 genome-wide association studies and 32,961 individuals of European and east Asian ancestry. We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P < 5 × 10(-4), Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P < 5 × 10(-8), including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1). These findings shed light on the genetic architecture and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying BMD variation and fracture susceptibility.},
