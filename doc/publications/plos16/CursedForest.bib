  Abstract                 = {Genome sequencing has the potential for
 stratified cancer treatment and improved diagnostics
 for rare disorders. However, sequencing needs to be
 utilised in risk stratification on a population
 scale to deepen the impact on the health system by
 addressing common diseases, where individual genomic
 variants have variable penetrance and minor
 impact. As the accuracy of genomic risk predictors
 is bounded by heritability, environmental factors
 such as diet, lifestyle, and microbiome have to be
 considered. Large-scale, longitudinal research
 programmes need to study the intrinsic properties
 between both genetics and environment to unravel
 their risk contribution. During this discovery
 process, frameworks need to be established to
 counteract unrealistic expectations. Sufficient
 scientific evidence is needed to interpret sources
 of uncertainty and inform decision making for
 clinical management and personal health.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.}

  Abstract                 = {Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is
 a common task in most gene expression studies, where
 researchers try to identify the smallest possible
 set of genes that can still achieve good predictive
 performance (for instance, for future use with
 diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene
 selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene)
 rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds
 to select the number of genes, can only be applied
 to two-class problems, and use gene selection
 ranking criteria unrelated to the classification
 algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a
 classification algorithm well suited for microarray
 data: it shows excellent performance even when most
 predictive variables are noise, can be used when the
 number of variables is much larger than the number
 of observations and in problems involving more than
 two classes, and returns measures of variable
 importance. Thus, it is important to understand the
 performance of random forest with microarray data
 and its possible use for gene selection.\\ We
 investigate the use of random forest for
 classification of microarray data (including
 multi-class problems) and propose a new method of
 gene selection in classification problems based on
 random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray
 data sets we show that random forest has comparable
 performance to other classification methods,
 including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene
 selection procedure yields very small sets of genes
 (often smaller than alternative methods) while
 preserving predictive accuracy.\\ Because of its
 performance and features, random forest and gene
 selection using random forest should probably become
 part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class
 prediction and gene selection with microarray data.}

 breakdown the theoretical and statistical basis of
 RF so that practitioners are able to apply it in

 measures. Applications specific to genetic studies

  Abstract                 = {The 1000 Genomes Project and disease-specific sequencing efforts are producing large collections of haplotypes that can be used as reference panels for genotype imputation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, imputing from large reference panels with existing methods imposes a high computational burden. We introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that maintains the accuracy of leading methods while reducing computational costs. We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the 1000 Genomes Project. This strategy will be particularly valuable for repeated imputation as reference panels evolve.},

  Abstract                 = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous
 complex disease affecting more than 29 million
 Americans alone with a rising prevalence trending
 toward steady increases in the coming decades. Thus,
 there is a pressing clinical need to improve early
 prevention and clinical management of T2D and its
 complications. Clinicians have understood that
 patients who carry the T2D diagnosis have a variety
 of phenotypes and susceptibilities to
 diabetes-related complications. We used a precision
 medicine approach to characterize the complexity of
 T2D patient populations based on high-dimensional
 electronic medical records (EMRs) and genotype data
 from 11,210 individuals. We successfully identified
 three distinct subgroups of T2D from topology-based
 patient-patient networks. Subtype 1 was
 characterized by T2D complications diabetic
 nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; subtype 2 was
 enriched for cancer malignancy and cardiovascular
 diseases; and subtype 3 was associated most strongly
 with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases,
 allergies, and HIV infections. We performed a
 genetic association analysis of the emergent T2D
 subtypes to identify subtype-specific genetic
 markers and identified 1279, 1227, and 1338
 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped
 to 425, 322, and 437 unique genes specific to
 subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By assessing the
 human disease-SNP association for each subtype, the
 enriched phenotypes and biological functions at the
 gene level for each subtype matched with the disease
 comorbidities and clinical differences that we
 identified through EMRs. Our approach demonstrates
 the utility of applying the precision medicine
 paradigm in T2D and the promise of extending the
 approach to the study of other complex,
 multifactorial diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests (RFs) are a promising alternative to standard single SNP analyses in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). RFs provide variable importance measures (VIMs) to rank SNPs according to their predictive power. However, in contrast to the established genome-wide significance threshold, no clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs should be selected for downstream analyses.We propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent relative variable importance measure (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative to an observed minimal importance score for several runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in all of the runs are selected as important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show that the new method controls the number of false-positives under the null hypothesis. Under a simple alternative hypothesis with several independent main effects it is only slightly less powerful than logistic regression. In an experimental GWAS data set, the same strong signal is identified while the approach selects none of the SNPs in an underpowered GWAS.The novel variable selection method r2VIM is a promising extension to standard RF for objectively selecting relevant SNPs in GWAS while controlling the number of false-positive results.},

  Abstract                 = {A genome-wide association study (GWAS) can be a powerful tool for the identification of genes associated with agronomic traits in crop species, but it is often hindered by population structure and the large extent of linkage disequilibrium. In this study, we identified agronomically important genes in rice using GWAS based on whole-genome sequencing, followed by the screening of candidate genes based on the estimated effect of nucleotide polymorphisms. Using this approach, we identified four new genes associated with agronomic traits. Some genes were undetectable by standard SNP analysis, but we detected them using gene-based association analysis. This study provides fundamental insights relevant to the rapid identification of genes associated with agronomic traits using GWAS and will accelerate future efforts aimed at crop improvement.},
