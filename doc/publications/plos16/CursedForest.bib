  Abstract                 = {Genome sequencing has the potential for stratified cancer treatment and improved diagnostics for rare disorders. However, sequencing needs to be utilised in risk stratification on a population scale to deepen the impact on the health system by addressing common diseases, where individual genomic variants have variable penetrance and minor impact. As the accuracy of genomic risk predictors is bounded by heritability, environmental factors such as diet, lifestyle, and microbiome have to be considered. Large-scale, longitudinal research programmes need to study the intrinsic properties between both genetics and environment to unravel their risk contribution. During this discovery process, frameworks need to be established to counteract unrealistic expectations. Sufficient scientific evidence is needed to interpret sources of uncertainty and inform decision making for clinical management and personal health.},

  Abstract                 = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous complex disease affecting more than 29 million Americans alone with a rising prevalence trending toward steady increases in the coming decades. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to improve early prevention and clinical management of T2D and its complications. Clinicians have understood that patients who carry the T2D diagnosis have a variety of phenotypes and susceptibilities to diabetes-related complications. We used a precision medicine approach to characterize the complexity of T2D patient populations based on high-dimensional electronic medical records (EMRs) and genotype data from 11,210 individuals. We successfully identified three distinct subgroups of T2D from topology-based patient-patient networks. Subtype 1 was characterized by T2D complications diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; subtype 2 was enriched for cancer malignancy and cardiovascular diseases; and subtype 3 was associated most strongly with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, allergies, and HIV infections. We performed a genetic association analysis of the emergent T2D subtypes to identify subtype-specific genetic markers and identified 1279, 1227, and 1338 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped to 425, 322, and 437 unique genes specific to subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By assessing the human disease-SNP association for each subtype, the enriched phenotypes and biological functions at the gene level for each subtype matched with the disease comorbidities and clinical differences that we identified through EMRs. Our approach demonstrates the utility of applying the precision medicine paradigm in T2D and the promise of extending the approach to the study of other complex, multifactorial diseases.},

  abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical
	methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical
	classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively
	unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical
	classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a
	novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model
	complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to
	perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression,
	classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and
	(5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies
	of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using
	data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument,
	California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest,
	USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains,
	Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications
	as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data,
	by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification
	methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as
	most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with
	expectations based on the literature.},
